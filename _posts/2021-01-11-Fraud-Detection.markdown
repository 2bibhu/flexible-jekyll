# Machine learning
Hey guys! First of all thank you for visiting my profile. I'm a student learning Machine Learning And AI This repository is to act like a high level overview of the data science projects I've worked on. Each project's README.md should act as a full description of the project, but I'll provide a short description here for convenience. All of these projects are in Python. Links are provided to projects whose code can be made public.

## Fraud detection
Machine Learning methods for fraud detection can be divided into supervised and unsupervised models, where supervised methods demand a big amount of data, such as fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions in equal amounts to train the model. Unsupervised methods search patterns and correlations in the raw data and the prediction is built without the additional labeling. Supervised ML methods are considered to be more accurate while unsupervised take much less time to prepare.
